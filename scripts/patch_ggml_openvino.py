"""Fourteen fixes to the fetched ggml OpenVINO backend.

ggml-openvino is written against llama.cpp's graphs: one decoder-only
transformer, one position input, an F16 KV cache. vla.cpp drives it with vision
towers and action experts instead, which is legal ggml but nothing the backend
has seen. Eight of the hunks below narrow an llama.cpp-shaped assumption back to
the ggml contract, two fill gaps in the op table, and two are about the path
those graphs take. Together they are what lets SmolVLA and pi0.5 run end to end
on the CPU, GPU and NPU plugins. Numbers 4 and 5 are the ones worth upstreaming.

A hunk that applies is not a hunk that runs. Whenever VLA_LLAMA_TAG moves, check
that each patched function still has a live caller, not just that its anchor
still matches: b10729 moved the position-input naming out of the GgmlOvDecoder
member that fix 4 patches and into a free function, and the fix went silently
dead while applying cleanly.

See docs/backend/ov.md for the measured results and for what is still blocked.

  1. ggml-openvino-extra.cpp - pick the *Intel* OpenCL platform.
     `GGML_OPENVINO_DEVICE=GPU` builds an OpenVINO remote context on an OpenCL
     queue and takes the first platform the ICD loader reports. With more than
     one runtime installed (an NVIDIA card next to the Intel iGPU, POCL,
     Rusticl) that is whichever `/etc/OpenCL/vendors/*.icd` sorted first, and
     the GPU plugin only accepts an Intel context -- it aborts at startup with
     "Incompatible OpenCL runtime: program is not in expected ELF format".
     Selecting by `CL_PLATFORM_VENDOR` leaves single-runtime boxes unchanged.

  2. ggml-decoder.cpp - narrow RESHAPE op_case 3.
     Case 3 is the KV-cache flatten, `[512,1024,1,1] -> [1,524288,1,1]`, and it
     emits a shape with `-1` in dim 2 and 1 in dim 3. Its guard only tests
     `src->ne[0]*ne[1]*ne[2] == node->ne[1]`, which also matches the kernel
     reshape inside `ggml_conv_2d` (`[16,16,3,768] -> [768,768]`) and mangles
     it. The real case always has `node->ne[0] == 1`; requiring that sends the
     conv kernel to case 6, the plain reshape.

  3. openvino/op/flash_attn_ext.cpp - convert K/V to F16 with Q.
     The translator converts Q, the mask and the scale to F16 because
     llama.cpp's KV cache already is. vla.cpp keeps K/V in F32, and OpenVINO's
     SDPA rejects mixed input types ("Mixed input types are not supported").
     Converting K/V too matches the precision the translator already chose.

  4. ggml-decoder.{h,cpp} - stop distinct position inputs aliasing each other.
     Every tensor feeding a ROPE's second input is renamed to one graph
     parameter called "inp_pos", because an llama.cpp graph has exactly one.
     add_rope_sin_cos() then builds a single shared sin/cos table from it. Every
     vla.cpp arch has several position tensors -- SmolVLA passes a prefill, a
     full and a rebased one -- so they alias each other and every ROPE takes the
     table built from whichever won, which fails shape inference:
     "Multiply (Split[1]:f32[1,113,5,32], Multiply[0]:f32[1,50,1,32])
      Argument shapes are inconsistent."
     When the graph has more than one, keep each tensor's own name. Nothing is
     then called "inp_pos", so translate_rope() falls back to building sin/cos
     per op from its own position input. Single-position graphs are untouched.
     This one is what carries an arch through to a full prediction.

     Patch the free function get_tensor_graph_input_ov_name() in
     ggml-decoder.cpp, not just the GgmlOvDecoder member. b10729 relocated the
     naming into that free function and left the member behind with no callers;
     patching only the member applies cleanly and does nothing at all. Both are
     patched here so the fix survives whichever one upstream keeps.

  5. utils.{h,cpp} - cache what the naive path compiles.
     The dynamic and static paths keep a `graph_key`-indexed cache of the
     decoder and the compiled infer request; the naive path has none, so it
     rebuilt the decoder, re-converted the model and called compile_model() on
     every single ggml_backend_graph_compute. That is the dominant cost once a
     real graph goes through it: SmolVLA on the CPU plugin drops from 22.7 s to
     1.4 s per prediction with the cache in place. A hit rebinds the cached
     decoder to the new graph through the existing update_io(), which is how the
     dynamic path already handles freshly built tensors.
     The key is `naive_key`, not `graph_key`: the latter is n_nodes plus the
     first and last node name, which two graphs of the same size can share, and
     a compiled model is bound to the shapes it was built for. Reusing one
     across a shape change returns another graph's answer with no error, so the
     key mixes in every node's op and shape. The map is bounded; see the comment
     on the flush.

  6. openvino/op_table.cpp - get both GELU flavours right.
     ggml has two: GGML_UNARY_OP_GELU is the tanh approximation, GGML_UNARY_OP_
     GELU_ERF is the exact one. The table mapped GELU onto ov's Gelu, which
     defaults to erf, and had no entry for GELU_ERF at all. So the tanh op was
     computed as erf, and an arch using the erf op could not run at all - and
     with no per-op CPU fallback in the core, "could not run" means the whole
     prediction. Small per node, but a vision tower has dozens and the error
     compounds: setting the mode explicitly moved VLA-JEPA from 5.5e-3 to 1.1e-4
     and GR00T N1.5 from 2.7e-2 to 6.0e-4, turning both from "runs but drifts"
     into supported. The highest-yield single fix here.
     RELU, NEG and SQR were missing here too; upstream added all three in b10729.

  7. openvino/utils.cpp - give a folded weight its full rank before slicing.
     A ggml tensor that is 2-D folds in as a rank-2 ov constant, which is what a
     GEMM operand wants, but process_view_input_new() indexes a viewed tensor at
     its full ggml rank, so the slice axis lands outside it:
     "Slice (Constant aex.blk.0.attn_in.weight[0]:bf16[2688,896], ...)
      Axis 2 out of the tensor rank range [-2, 1]."
     Evo-1 hits it by viewing Q, K and V out of one fused attn_in weight.
     Left-pad the input with 1s, which is the shape ggml gave it anyway.

  8. openvino/op/concat.cpp - align input ranks.
     The same rank-2 constants reach CONCAT, which unlike the broadcasting
     elementwise ops needs both inputs at the graph's rank or the axis falls
     outside them. Evo-1 concatenates a CLS weight onto 4-D patch embeddings;
     SmolVLA concatenates a precomputed time tile onto a 4-D activation. Padding
     here is what saves each arch from working around it, e.g. by moving
     SmolVLA's time tiles into a buffer of their own.

  9. openvino/utils.cpp - bound the interleaved-mrope sector cycle by sections.
     ggml's IMROPE cycles t/h/w by sector % 3, but only while the sector is
     inside 3 * sections[k]; past that it falls through to the fourth position
     stream (ggml_rope_cache_init in ggml/src/ggml-cpu/ops.cpp). The translator
     cycled unconditionally, so with sections {24,20,20,0} and n_dims 128
     sectors 61 and 62 took h and w instead of e. NOTE: this matches the ggml
     reference but had no measurable effect on any arch tested here, because the
     fourth stream happens to carry the same positions as the first. Kept
     because it removes a real divergence from the reference, not because a
     measurement demanded it.

 10. utils.cpp - make the naive-path graph-size threshold settable.
     Graphs under 20 nodes bypass the LLM decoder and translate literally, with
     static shapes and no KV-cache inference. That literal path is the one that
     suits a vision tower, but a vision tower is ~450 nodes. The constant
     becomes `GGML_OPENVINO_NAIVE_GRAPH_SIZE`; src/backend.h defaults it high
     for vla.cpp and an explicit setting still wins. Parsed with strtol, because
     atoi turns junk into 0 and that would send every graph down the LLM builder
     with nothing said.

 11. ggml-decoder.cpp - require a ROPE before taking PERMUTE op_case 2.
     op_case 2 rewrites the tensor as [n_seq, -1, n_heads, head_size] and only
     then transposes, which is correct for llama.cpp's rope'd query and nothing
     else. The classifier reached it for ANY permute whose source is a view of a
     non-leaf, so GR00T N1.7's DiT cross-attention V - ggml_permute(view, 1,2,0,3)
     over a fused KV projection - was reshaped into a shape unrelated to it and
     came out with its elements rearranged: V was 139% wrong while K, which uses
     permute(0,2,1,3) and happened to survive the same rewrite, was 0.04%. That
     turned into a 27% error in the final actions. Walking the view/reshape/cont
     chain and requiring a ROPE at the end sends every other permute to op_case 1,
     the plain transpose. This is what makes GR00T N1.7 correct (27% -> 0.005%).

 12. ggml-decoder.cpp + openvino/op/add.cpp - do not stack two elementwise adds
     on a GEMM. The GPU plugin folds elementwise ops into the preceding GEMM as
     post-ops. Given ADD(ADD(residual, GEMM), graph_input) it folds both, and the
     second operand is silently lost: the result equals the inner add, as though
     the outer one never ran. Nothing is logged. An llama.cpp graph never builds
     that chain - one residual add per sub-block - but a VLA does, wherever a
     tower's features are added on top of an FFN residual. It cost VLA-JEPA,
     GR00T N1.7 and pi0 their GPU support, while every other arch was unaffected.
     Addition is associative, so re-hang the outer add on the inner one's
     non-GEMM operand: the GEMM keeps exactly one post-op and the arithmetic is
     unchanged. op_case 2/3 records which of the inner add's operands is the
     GEMM, because ggml's operand order is not fixed.
     Found by bisecting VLA-JEPA with GGML_OPENVINO_DEBUG_NODE: its ViT and DiT
     graphs matched the CPU plugin to 0.2%, the VLM prefill was already wrong at
     the end of layer 0, and within that layer the divergence was one node - the
     FFN residual add under the deepstack add. The same fusion path already has a
     known defect with broadcast DIV; see ggml_backend_openvino_supports_op.

 13. ggml-openvino-extra.cpp - expose the GPU plugin's inference precision.
     The GPU plugin computes in f16 unless told otherwise, which is most of why
     it is fast, and for nearly every graph that is the right trade. It is not
     the right trade for a graph carrying a long serial chain - a flow-matching
     denoise loop unrolled inside one graph - because the error compounds across
     every step with nothing to reset it, and a saturating output channel can
     then cross its threshold in the wrong place. pi0 does exactly that: on the
     GPU its continuous action dims land 4e-2 from an F32 reference and its
     bistable gripper flips one step early, which is a 1.7 max|delta| on a metric
     and a late grasp on a robot. GGML_OPENVINO_GPU_PRECISION=f32 puts it at
     6.5e-5. Exposed rather than forced: f32 costs about 3x on this plugin, so
     src/backend.h defaults it for pi0 alone and an explicit setting still wins.

 14. openvino/op_table.cpp + ggml-openvino.cpp - translate BitVLA's activation
     quantiser, and only that one. Ten of vla.cpp's eleven architectures build
     graphs out of stock ggml ops; BitVLA builds one op of its own, the BitNet
     per-row int8 fake-quant, and that single gap is the whole reason it pinned
     itself to the CPU backend and never reached this one (docs/backend/ov.md).
     It is six OpenVINO nodes and no new numerics -- see translate_bitvla_act_quant
     for the two steps in it that look redundant and are not.
     The awkward half is that it arrives as GGML_OP_MAP_CUSTOM1, which is not an
     op so much as a slot: the kernel is a host function pointer, invisible to any
     backend, so a second model using the slot for something else would be
     mistranslated into a fake-quant rather than rejected. Hence the name test, in
     the translator and again in ggml_backend_openvino_device_supports_op -- the
     latter because that function derives its supported set from the op table's
     keys, so the table entry alone would have this backend claim every custom op
     in existence and then throw on it instead of leaving it to the CPU.

Idempotent - re-running on a patched tree is a no-op, so a reconfigure that
re-populates the FetchContent source dir is safe either way.
