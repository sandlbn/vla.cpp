 * @file backend.h
 * @brief Compute-backend selection shared by every in-tree arch.
 *
 * Each arch used to open-code the same accelerator-then-CPU ladder, so adding a
 * backend meant editing a dozen files. They all call @ref vla::backend_init
 * instead; the ladder lives here once.
 *
 * Exactly one accelerator is compiled in, picked by the CMake flag that was
 * used (`GGML_CUDA` / `GGML_SYCL` / `GGML_METAL` / `GGML_OPENVINO`). There is no
 * per-op CPU fallback: the core drives a single backend through `gallocr` rather
 * than a scheduler, so an arch that hits an op the backend does not implement
 * asserts at predict time instead of silently limping.

 * never named ends up with many tensors sharing one name. That is legal ggml,
 * and llama.cpp never trips over it because it labels every node it builds.
 *
 * ggml-openvino keys its translation map on those names: two nodes with the same
 * name silently become one, and the graph it hands OpenVINO wires the wrong
 * tensor into the next op. Renaming duplicates in place before compute is enough
 * to keep them apart, and only the OpenVINO build pays for it -- elsewhere this
